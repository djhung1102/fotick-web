                  You understand and acknowledge that when you purchase a
                  product on FoTick such as the PRO subcription, you are
                  directly paying Apple through In-App Purchases. FoTick

                  after 14 days from the purchase day.

                  receipt of your purchases (contained in the app) to the Apple

                  servers, FoTick we&apos;ll try to validate your receipt
                  locally. If Apple fails to return the app receipt in the app
                  bundle, we won&apos;t be able to validate your purchases. In
                  these cases, you are invited to logout/login from your
