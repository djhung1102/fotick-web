                  You understand and acknowledge that &quot;Family Sharing&quot;
                  is a service offered by Apple, and therefore you are subject
                  to its terms and conditions. In particular, they report that
                  you can only belong to one Family at a time, and may join any
                  Family no more than twice per year. You can change the Apple
                  ID you associate with a Family no more than once every 90
                  days. These terms are subject to eventual changes from Apple.
                  &quot;Family Sharing&quot; is maintained by Apple and Xtify
                  doesn&apos;t have any connection to it, except the fact that
                  it offers a subscription with Apple &quot;Family Sharing&quot;
                  enabled.
